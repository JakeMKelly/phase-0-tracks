# Write a method that takes user input and SPLITs the string into individual 
# characters and keeps them in an array, and swaps the first and last name.
# GET the user's name
# Swap the first and last name, first by SPLITting them, then ROTATE them
# Seperate them into individual CHARS.
	# IF the letter is a vowel,
		# convert the letter into the next vowel in the string, 'aeioua'
	# or ELSE if it is a consonant, 
		# convert the letter into the next consonant in the string 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz'
# JOIN the newly MAPped letters and PRINT them to the console		

#Expectation: the INPUT 'Felicia Torres' will have an OUTPUT of 'Vussit Gimodoe'



 #UI 
  # Ask user for first and last name to encode, type UNTIL they type 'exit'.

# Store each new name in a HASH, and print each key/value pair in a user-friendly
# manner when finished.
