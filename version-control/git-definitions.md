# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* Minor change added here.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is a way to keep track of all changes made to and past versions of a file or set of files.
  It's useful because you can preserve your code that you already have, but add to it or make changes without risk of compromising the rest of your work. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  A branch is an area to work on or make changes to your base code seperate from the main copy of it. 
  You would use one to preserve the master branch, while being able to search for errors or bugs in any new additions you make before adding it to your base.Also, it allows someone else to review changes made before allowing it to become a part of the master branch

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

 A commit is a record of the changes you've made, like a submission to update whatever you are working on.  A good commit message is one that clearly tells what's been changed or added.

* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict happens when the same block of code are changed in different branches, and it requires user input to determine what changes to keep and which ones to discard. From what I have read, they aren't a whole lot of fun.
