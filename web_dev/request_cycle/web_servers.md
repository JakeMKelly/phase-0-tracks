## Release 1

1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? 

  Allow users full access. Assume users know what they are doing. (don't ask 'are you sure'). Make flexibility, simplicity, and freedom the most important considerations.
  A VPS is a reserved, walled-off chunk of memory that runs an operating system.  A user is given full access to everything in that OS to build whatever they would like. 

2. What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

  It's dedicated entirely to whatever you are building. Memory is used for nothing but what you've built.  
  Also, any other data is kept out of it, as it can't access other files on your local device, and is held seperate. 

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

  Because it makes it easier for steal access remotely without your permission.  Kind of like leaving your username as the default one or leaving your password as 'password1'.
