1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

Query: SELECT * FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Output:
1|Jake|Kelly|1|4|Friendly service.|2|1|2|Starbucks
2|Austin|Kading|2|1|GOT POISONED|1|2|1|Taco Time
2|Austin|Kading|3|5|Very fasat shipping|3|2|3|Amazon   

2.There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

Query:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.comment, reviews.stars FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Output:
Jake|Kelly|Starbucks|Friendly service.|4
Austin|Kading|Taco Time|GOT POISONED|1
Austin|Kading|Amazon|Very fasat shipping|5

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

Query:
 SELECT * FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE businesses.name="Amazon";

Output:
2|Austin|Kading|3|5|Very fasat shipping|3|2|3|Amazon
